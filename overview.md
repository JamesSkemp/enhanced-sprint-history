Enhanced Sprint History supports viewing changes to user stories, or optionally other supported work items, in an iteration over time.

It features:
1. Three charts showing the sprint state.
2. The history of work item changes on the sprint.
3. A listing of all items that are or were in the sprint.
4. The ability to add other work item types.
	- Additional work item types must have the built-in **Story Points** field.

Users can select the team and iteration they want to view information for:
